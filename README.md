# NoteApp
This is a smaller notetaking app I am making using WPF. I currently use Notion for all my notes, and it works great for keeping track of things, but sometimes I just want to be able to have a digital version of a sticky note. Windows does have a sticky note app, but it doesn't allow for headings, toggles, and loads of other features I would like.
